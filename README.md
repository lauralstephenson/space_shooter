This is a space invader-type space shooter game using Pygame.
Spaceships come down and the defender is at the bottom shooting upward.
Move back and forth with A and D and with W and S.
Use the spacebar to shoot the space invader ships coming down.
If your ship hits the space invader ships, you lose a life.
Click any mouse button to begin.

Thanks to Tech with Tim for teaching me Pygame and so much more!
